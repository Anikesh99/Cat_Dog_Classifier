# Cat_Dog_Classifier
A Flask hosted model to differentiate between cats and dogs using a trained ML model

Using the pytorch library to train a Convoluted Neural Network (CNN) model to distingusih between cats and dogs. Users can pass in images into the model from a web interface and the model outputs whether the image is that of a cat or dog. 

Prerequistes:
1. Python 3.x

Steps to use:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install all the dependencies needed - Pytorch, Flask, Pillow and Pickle
3. Run the code using the terminal command `Flash Run` from the same directory as App.py
4. Use the web interface to input an image into the model
